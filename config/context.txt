 1. I am trying to build the logic in job load_convert_all_docs.py that converts all the documents from a input collection to a format that looks like in this sample file apples_60017.json. 
 2. During the conversion, make sure you have the root level keys are same as in the sample file.
 3. the keys under 'spec', 'tolerance' and 'defectscoringguide' are flattened out in sample file by splitting underscore('_')
4. analyze the sample file key structure and build the logic in load_convert_all_docs.py
